      <h1>Why We Started</h1>
      <p>
        We founded LearnWeb3 with one goal in mind: to onboard as many
        developers into Web3 as possible. In the early 2000s, we saw an
        unprecedented boom in web2 that lead us to the internet we have today.
        In 2022, the same thing is happening again with Web3 and the metaverse.
        However, learning Web3 is not easy. There is a lot of information
        fragmentation, and not all knowledge gaps are properly addressed. We saw
        a great need for a place where developers can come and learn everything
        there is to know to get to a point where they can feel very confident in
        developing their own dApps and protocols. We want there to be diversity
        in who benefits from Web3. Our mission is to create a grassroots
        organization that creates fully-fledged developers and brings them into
        the ecosystem. We advocate for women, people of colour, and other
        underrepresented groups in tech, with the mission of creating as many
        Web3 developers as possible.
